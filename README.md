# jira-rest-typescript

This is just a TypeScript definition file for use with the Jira REST API. The shape of the JSON objects returned by the Jira REST API can be exceptionally difficult to remember. While the `editmeta` and `createmeta` are exceptionally helpful, it's far better to have soemthing built into the tooling of your editor to help with Jira REST projects.
